    <h2>Skillset</h2>
    <p>
      With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person
      to hire when it comes to a full fledged project. Whatever your needs are,
      I can pretty much take on any challenge.

        <h3>Product Design</h3>
        <p>
          Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users,
          solve problems and build great products.

        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
          My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for
          design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.

        <h3>Motion Design</h3>
        <p>
          I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
          Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the
          flexibility of story telling.

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
          Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
          really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
